# IndianSignLanguageInterpreter

Communication for the majority of people is not difficult. It should be the same way for the deaf and mute people. Inability to speak is indeed a true disability and such people use different modes to communicate with others. There are a number of methods available for their communication and one such method of communication is sign language. Developing an Indian sign language application for deaf and mute people can prove to be vital, as they’ll be able to communicate easily with even those who don’t understand sign language. Our project offers a platform for bridging the communication gap between speaking people and deaf and dumb people with the help of sign language. The main focus of this work is to create a vision-based system to identify Indian sign language gestures, keeping resource intensity of the application bare minimum. The project deals with designing and implementing a user-friendly and more intuitive way of communication. The paper primarily focuses on increasing the overall efficiency of the algorithm for Indian Sign Language recognition by leveraging Machine Learning to accurately predict
